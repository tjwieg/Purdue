# Hardware Connections
This project requires three external components and a few jumper wires to connect them:
 - LED
 - Resistor (e.g. 100 Ohm)
 - Momentary Switch (e.g. pushbutton)

**LED connection:** 3.3V --> LED --> Resistor --> Pin 13 (output, active low)

**Switch connection:** 3.3V --> Switch --> Pin 21 (input, internal pull-down)
