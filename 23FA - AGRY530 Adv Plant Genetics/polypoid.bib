  abstract   = {Plant breeding aims to develop improved crop varieties. Many crops have a polyploid and often highly heterozygous genome, which may make breeding of polyploid crops a real challenge. The efficiency of traditional breeding based on crossing and selection has been improved by using marker-assisted selection (MAS), and MAS is also being applied in polyploid crops, which helps e.g. for introgression breeding. However, methods such as random mutation breeding are difficult to apply in polyploid crops because there are multiple homoeologous copies (alleles) of each gene. Genome editing technology has revolutionized mutagenesis as it enables precisely selecting targets. The genome editing tool CRISPR/Cas is especially valuable for targeted mutagenesis in polyploids, as all alleles and/or copies of a gene can be targeted at once. Even multiple genes, each with multiple alleles, may be targeted simultaneously. In addition to targeted mutagenesis, targeted replacement of undesirable alleles by desired ones may become a promising application of genome editing for the improvement of polyploid crops, in the near future. Several examples of the application of genome editing for targeted mutagenesis are described here for a range of polyploid crops, and achievements and bottlenecks are highlighted.},

  abstract  = {Polyploidy is a prominent process in plants and has been significant in the evolutionary history of vertebrates and other eukaryotes. In plants, interdisciplinary approaches combining phylogenetic and molecular genetic perspectives have enhanced our awareness of the myriad genetic interactions made possible by polyploidy. Here, processes and mechanisms of gene and genome evolution in polyploids are reviewed. Genes duplicated by polyploidy may retain their original or similar function, undergo diversification in protein function or regulation, or one copy may become silenced through mutational or epigenetic means. Duplicated genes also may interact through inter-locus recombination, gene conversion, or concerted evolution. Recent experiments have illuminated important processes in polyploids that operate above the organizational level of duplicated genes. These include inter-genomic chromosomal exchanges, saltational, non-Mendelian genomic evolution in nascent polyploids, inter-genomic invasion, and cytonuclear stabilization. Notwithstanding many recent insights, much remains to be learned about many aspects of polyploid evolution, including: the role of transposable elements in structural and regulatory gene evolution; processes and significance of epigenetic silencing; underlying controls of chromosome pairing; mechanisms and functional significance of rapid genome changes; cytonuclear accommodation; and coordination of regulatory factors contributed by two, sometimes divergent progenitor genomes. Continued application of molecular genetic approaches to questions of polyploid genome evolution holds promise for producing lasting insight into processes by which novel genotypes are generated and ultimately into how polyploidy facilitates evolution and adaptation.},

  abstract = {Polyploidy, the possession of more than 2 complete genomes, is a major force in plant evolution known to affect the genetic and genomic constitution and the phenotype of an organism, which will have consequences for its ecology and geography as well as for lineage diversification and speciation. In this review, we discuss phylogenetic patterns in the incidence of polyploidy including possible underlying causes, the role of polyploidy for diversification, the effects of polyploidy on geographical and ecological patterns, and putative underlying mechanisms as well as chromosome evolution and evolution of repetitive DNA following polyploidization. Spurred by technological advances, a lot has been learned about these aspects both in model and increasingly also in nonmodel species. Despite this enormous progress, long-standing questions about polyploidy still cannot be unambiguously answered, due to frequently idiosyncratic outcomes and insufficient integration of different organizational levels (from genes to ecology), but likely this will change in the near future.

  abstract   = {Plant cytogenetic studies have provided essential knowledge on chromosome behavior during meiosis, contributing to our understanding of this complex process. In this review, we describe in detail the meiotic process in auto- and allopolyploids from the onset of prophase I through pairing, recombination, and bivalent formation, highlighting recent findings on the genetic control and mode of action of specific proteins that lead to diploid-like meiosis behavior in polyploid species. During the meiosis of newly formed polyploids, related chromosomes (homologous in autopolyploids; homologous and homoeologous in allopolyploids) can combine in complex structures called multivalents. These structures occur when multiple chromosomes simultaneously pair, synapse, and recombine. We discuss the effectiveness of crossover frequency in preventing multivalent formation and favoring regular meiosis. Homoeologous recombination in particular can generate new gene (locus) combinations and phenotypes, but it may destabilize the karyotype and lead to aberrant meiotic behavior, reducing fertility. In crop species, understanding the factors that control pairing and recombination has the potential to provide plant breeders with resources to make fuller use of available chromosome variations in number and structure. We focused on wheat and oilseed rape, since there is an abundance of elucidating studies on this subject, including the molecular characterization of the Ph1 (wheat) and PrBn (oilseed rape) loci, which are known to play a crucial role in regulating meiosis. Finally, we exploited the consequences of chromosome pairing and recombination for genetic map construction in polyploids, highlighting two case studies of complex genomes: (i) modern sugarcane, which has a man-made genome harboring two subgenomes with some recombinant chromosomes; and (ii) hexaploid sweet potato, a naturally occurring polyploid. The recent inclusion of allelic dosage information has improved linkage estimation in polyploids, allowing multilocus genetic maps to be constructed.},

  abstract  = {There has been recent rapid progress in the transformation of plants with foreign DNA, making use either of the natural routes of genetic invasion that viruses and bacteria have developed, or of chemical, mechanical and electrical tricks to make plant protoplast membranes permeable to nucleic acids. Genes integrated into plant virus genomes can be carried systemi cally from the initial site of infection into the rest of the plant. Genes placed between the borders of Agrobacterium tumefaciens T-DNA can be transferred into single cells or plant tissue, which then divides to produce wound calli, or as in the case of an Agrobacterium rhizogenes infection, grow out into new roots. Calli and roots can be grown into whole plants. If virus genomes are placed between the T-DNA borders, a very effective infectious route, termed "agroinfection", is established. Once inside a pro toplast, DNA finds its way into the nucleus where it can finally integrate into the resident chromosome and be expressed. Whether it can also find its way into chloroplasts is not yet clear, but at least translation products can be targeted into this organelle. Regeneration of whole organisms from single cells is a special feature of plants and offers a unique tool to study genes in a multicellular organism. In addition, as in animal cells, transcription and translation of trans forming genes can be studied in plant cells during "transient expression".},

  abstract  = {Targeted genetic engineering in many important model systems and in human tissue culture cells has historically been challenging. This has changed dramatically over the past 5 years with the development of zinc finger nuclease (ZFN) technology.A ZFN is an artificial endonuclease that consists of a designed zinc finger protein (ZFP) fused to the cleavage domain of the FokI restriction enzyme. A ZFN may be redesigned to cleave new targets by developing ZFPs with new sequence specificities.For genome engineering, a ZFN is targeted to cleave a chosen genomic sequence. The cleavage event induced by the ZFN provokes cellular repair processes that in turn mediate efficient modification of the targeted locus.If the ZFN-induced cleavage event is resolved via non-homologous end joining, this can result in small deletions or insertions, effectively leading to gene knockout. This approach has now been used to establish facile and efficient reverse genetics (that is, reverse genetics that does not require selection) in Drosophila melanogaster, zebrafish, rats, Arabidopsis thaliana and mammalian somatic cells.If the break is resolved via a homology-based process in the presence of an investigator-provided donor, small changes or entire transgenes can be transferred, often without selection, into the chromosome; this is referred to as 'gene correction' and 'gene addition', respectively. This approach has been used to make novel alleles in D. melanogaster, mammalian cells and tobacco, and has been used to drive targeted integration in maize, tobacco and human embryonic stem and induced pluripotent stem cells.Therapeutic application of ZFN technology requires the engineering of ZFNs that are highly specific in their action. Three clinical trials with ZFNs are underway, including one in which T cells are isolated from a patient infected with HIV, treated with ZFNs that disrupt the chemokine (C-C motif) receptor type 5 (CCR5) gene to make them resistant to virus infection, and transferred back to the patient.},

  abstract  = {The last two decades have marked significant advancement in the genome editing field. Three generations of programmable nucleases (ZFNs, TALENs, and CRISPR-Cas system) have been adopted to introduce targeted DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) in eukaryotic cells. DNA repair machinery of the cells has been exploited to introduce insertion and deletions (indels) at the targeted DSBs to study function of any gene-of-interest. The resulting indels were generally assumed to be “random” events produced by “error-prone” DNA repair pathways. However, recent advances in computational tools developed to study the Cas9-induced mutations have changed the consensus and implied the “non-randomness” nature of these mutations. Furthermore, CRISPR-centric tools are evolving at an unprecedented pace, for example, base- and prime-editors are the newest developments that have been added to the genome editing toolbox. Altogether, genome editing tools have revolutionized our way of conducting research in life sciences. Here, we present a concise overview of genome editing tools and describe the DNA repair pathways underlying the generation of genome editing outcome.},

  abstract  = {Homologous recombination (HR) and mismatch repair (MMR) are inextricably linked. HR pairs homologous chromosomes before meiosis I and is ultimately responsible for generating genetic diversity during sexual reproduction. HR is initiated in meiosis by numerous programmed DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs; several hundred in mammals). A characteristic feature of HR is the exchange of DNA strands, which results in the formation of heteroduplex DNA. Mismatched nucleotides arise in heteroduplex DNA because the participating parental chromosomes contain nonidentical sequences. These mismatched nucleotides may be processed by MMR, resulting in nonreciprocal exchange of genetic information (gene conversion). MMR and HR also play prominent roles in mitotic cells during genome duplication; MMR rectifies polymerase misincorporation errors, whereas HR contributes to replication fork maintenance, as well as the repair of spontaneous DSBs and genotoxic lesions that affect both DNA strands. MMR suppresses HR when the heteroduplex DNA contains excessive mismatched nucleotides, termed homeologous recombination. The regulation of homeologous recombination by MMR ensures the accuracy of DSB repair and significantly contributes to species barriers during sexual reproduction. This review discusses the history, genetics, biochemistry, biophysics, and the current state of studies on the role of MMR in homologous and homeologous recombination from bacteria to humans.},

The RNA-guided Cas9 endonuclease is usually delivered into plant cells as a DNA construct encoding Cas9 and the single guide RNA (sgRNA). However, constitutive expression of nucleases may cause off target mutations. In addition, DNA constructs can integrate into the host genome, causing mutations and complicating regulatory approval. Instead of DNA, here we deliver Cas9 through the Agrobacterium T4SS, accomplished by fusion of the VirF T4SS translocation peptide to Cas9 (NCas9F). Co-cultivation of Agrobacteria expressing NCas9F with yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) harboring a sgRNA targeting CAN1 showed that NCas9F was translocated via T4SS and induced targeted mutations in the yeast genome. Infiltration of Nicotiana benthamiana leaves with Agrobacteria expressing NCas9F and sgRNA-PHYTOENE DESATURASE (PDS) resulted in targeted modifications at the PDS locus, albeit at a very low rate. In order to increase the mutation frequency NCas9F protein was co-transported with a T-DNA encoding sgRNA-PDS1. Next generation sequencing confirmed that this resulted in targeted mutations at the PDS locus with a similar distribution but at a 5-fold lower frequency as the mutations obtained with a T-DNA encoding both Cas9 and sgRNA-PDS1. Similarly, infection with Tobacco rattle virus (TRV) encoding sgRNA-PDS2 combined with NCas9F protein translocation resulted in an equally high frequency of PDS mutations in N. benthamiana compared to T-DNA encoded sgRNA-PDS1 combined with NCas9F protein translocation. Our results revealed that translocation of NCas9F protein via the Agrobacterium T4SS can be used for targeted mutagenesis in host cells instead of the permanent and constitutive expression of Cas9 from a T-DNA.},

Oilseed rape originated from hybridisation events between progenitor diploid species B. rapa and B. oleracea, both important vegetable species. The diploid progenitors are also ancient polyploids, with remnants of two previous polyploidisation events evident in the triplicated genome structure. This history of polyploid evolution and human agricultural selection makes B. napus an excellent model with which to investigate processes of genomic evolution and selection in polyploid crops. The ease of de novo interspecific hybridisation, responsiveness to tissue culture, and the close relationship of oilseed rape to the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana, coupled with the recent availability of reference genome sequences and suites of molecular cytogenetic and high-throughput genotyping tools, allow detailed dissection of genetic, genomic and phenotypic interactions in this crop. In this review we discuss the past and present uses of B. napus as a model for polyploid speciation and evolution in crop species, along with current and developing analysis tools and resources. We further outline unanswered questions that may now be tractable to investigation.},

Many crops of dietary and economic importance, such as wheat, cotton, rapeseed-mustard, and potato, are polyploids with complex genomes. Therefore, progress in these crops has been hampered due to genome complexity. Excellent work has been conducted on some species of Brassica for its improvement through genome editing. Although excellent work has been conducted on some species of Brassica for genome improvement through editing, work on polyploid crops, including U’s triangle species, holds numerous implications for improving other polyploid crops. In this review, we summarize key examples from genome editing work done on Brassica and discuss important considerations for deploying CRISPR-mediated genome editing more efficiently in other polyploid crops for improvement.},

New site-directed mutagenesis techniques that can directly edit the target genes without any integration of recombinant DNA are especially favorable. Here we present a successful pipeline for site-directed mutagenesis in tetraploid potato through transient TALEN expression in protoplasts. The transfection efficiency of protoplasts was 38–39\% and the site-directed mutation frequency was 7–8\% with a few base deletions as the predominant type of mutation. Among the protoplast-derived calli, 11–13\% showed mutations and a similar frequency (10\%) was observed in the regenerated shoots.

Advancements in cytogenetic and molecular tools, including high-density genetic mapping, florescent in situ hybridization, and genome and EST sequencing, have enabled new insights into genome composition and the history of genome duplications in crop plants. We review this evidence and discuss the relevance of genome duplication to crop improvement. Polyploidy provides genome buffering, increased allelic diversity and heterozygosity, and permits novel phenotypic variation to be generated. Polyploid formation is often accompanied with loss of duplicated chromatin, changes in gene expression, novel epistatic interactions, and endosperm effects. All of these factors need be considered in a genome-wide context for optimizing marker assisted selection and crop plant improvement.},

The binary vector pCAMBIA2300 was modified by incorporating multiple left border (Mlb®) repeats and was tested in BY2 cells, tobacco, and cassava plants to address this issue. PCR analyses confirmed a twofold increase in the vector backbone free events in the presence of triple left borders in all three systems tested. Vector backbone read-through past the LB was reduced significantly; however, the inclusion of Mlbs® did not effectively address the beyond right border read-through. Also, Mlbs® increased the frequency of single-copy and vector backbone free events (clean events) twice compared to a single LB construct. Here, we briefly narrate the strength and limitations of using Mlb® technology and reporter genes in reducing the vector backbone transfer in transgenic events.},

When coupled with a recently streamlined regulatory process by the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the potential to generate transgene-free varieties, genome-editing provides a new avenue for crop improvement. For heterozygous, polyploid and vegetatively propagated crops such as cultivated potato, Solanum tuberosum Group Tuberosum L., genome-editing presents tremendous opportunities for trait improvement. In potato, traits such as improved resistance to cold-induced sweetening, processing efficiency, herbicide tolerance, modified starch quality and self-incompatibility have been targeted utilizing CRISPR/Cas9 and TALEN reagents in diploid and tetraploid clones. However, limited progress has been made in other such crops including sweetpotato, strawberry, grapes, citrus, banana etc., In this review we summarize the developments in genome-editing platforms, delivery mechanisms applicable to plants and then discuss the recent developments in regulation of genome-edited crops in the United States and The European Union. Next, we provide insight into the challenges of genome-editing in clonally propagated polyploid crops, their current status for trait improvement with future prospects focused on potato, a global food security crop.},

For plant genome editing, the genome-editing reagents are usually expressed in plant cells from stably integrated transgenes within the genome. This requires crossing processes to remove foreign nucleotides from the genome to generate null segregants. However, in highly heterozygous plants such as potato, the progeny lines have different agronomic traits from the parent cultivar and do not necessarily become elite lines. Agrobacteria can transfer exogenous genes on T-DNA into plant cells. This has been used both to transform plants stably and to express the genes transiently in plant cells. Here, we infected potato, with Agrobacterium tumefaciens harboring TALEN-expression vector targeting sterol side chain reductase 2 (SSR2) gene and regenerated shoots without selection. We obtained regenerated lines with disrupted-SSR2 gene and without transgene of the TALEN gene, revealing that their disruption should be caused by transient gene expression. The strategy using transient gene expression by Agrobacterium that we call Agrobacterial mutagenesis, developed here should accelerate the use of genome-editing technology to modify heterozygous plant genomes.},

Conventional transgene-mediated CRISPR–Cas reagent delivery methods may be associated with unanticipated genome changes or damage1,2, with prolonged breeding cycles involving foreign DNA segregation and with regulatory restrictions regarding transgenesis3. Therefore, DNA-free delivery has been developed by transfecting preassembled CRISPR–Cas9 ribonucleoproteins into protoplasts4 or in vitro fertilized zygotes5. However, technical difficulties in regeneration from these wall-less cells make impractical a general adaption of these approaches to most crop species. Alternatively, CRISPR–Cas ribonucleoproteins or RNA transcripts have been biolistically bombarded into immature embryo cells or calli to yield highly specific genome editing, albeit at low frequency6–9. Here we report the engineering of a plant negative-strand RNA virus-based vector for DNA-free in planta delivery of the entire CRISPR–Cas9 cassette to achieve single, multiplex mutagenesis and chromosome deletions at high frequency in a model allotetraploid tobacco host. Over 90\% of plants regenerated from virus-infected tissues without selection contained targeted mutations, among which up to 57\% carried tetra-allelic, inheritable mutations. The viral vector remained stable even after mechanical transmission, and can readily be eliminated from mutated plants during regeneration or after seed setting. Despite high on-target activities, off-target effects, if any, are minimal. Our study provides a convenient, highly efficient and cost-effective approach for CRISPR–Cas9 gene editing in plants through virus infection.},

The cytoplasmic-nuclear male-sterility (CMS)-based hybrids have recorded 28.4\% yield superiority over local checks in farmers’ fields. This paper besides summarizing the reports of all the genetic and CMS systems, also discusses the prospects of utilizing these male-sterility systems in commercial hybrid breeding programmes.},

In this study, we cloned and characterized TaDA1, a conserved negative regulator of kernel size in wheat (Triticum aestivum). The overexpression of TaDA1 decreased the size and weight of wheat kernels, while its down-regulation using RNA interference (RNAi) had the opposite effect. Three TaDA1-A haplotypes were identified in Chinese wheat core collections, and a haplotype association analysis showed that TaDA1-A-HapI was significantly correlated with the production of larger kernels and higher kernel weights in modern Chinese cultivars. The haplotype effect resulted from a difference in TaDA1-A expression levels between genotypes, with TaDA1-A-HapI resulting in lower TaDA1-A expression levels. This favourable haplotype was found having been positively selected during wheat breeding over the last century. Furthermore, we demonstrated that TaDA1-A physically interacts with TaGW2-B. The additive effects of TaDA1-A and TaGW2-B on kernel weight were confirmed not only by the phenotypic enhancement arising from the simultaneous down-regulation of TaDA1 and TaGW2 expression, but also by the combinational haplotype effects estimated from multi-environment field data from 348 wheat cultivars. A comparative proteome analysis of developing transgenic and wild-type grains indicated that TaDA1 and TaGW2 are involved in partially overlapping but relatively independent protein regulatory networks. Thus, we have identified an important gene controlling kernel size in wheat and determined its interaction with other genes regulating kernel weight, which could have beneficial applications in wheat breeding.},

It contained an open reading frame of 1 848 bp and encodes a peptide of 615 amino acids. Multiple sequence alignments showed that TaNCED1 shared high identity with NCEDs from other plants. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that TaNCED1 was most closely related to a barley HvNCED1 gene. The predicted 3D structure of TaNCED1 showed high similarity with other homologues. Southern blot analysis indicated that TaNCED1 was a single copy in the genome of wheat. TaNCED1 was differentially expressed in various organs and the expression was up-regulated by low temperature, drought, NaCl, and ABA. Heterologous expression of TaNCED1 in tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) significantly improved its drought tolerance.

This study demonstrates a general strategy and platform for precise processing and efficient production of numerous gRNAs in vivo from a synthetic polycistronic gene via the endogenous tRNA-processing system. This strategy is shown to significantly increase CRISPR/Cas9 multiplex editing capability and efficiency in plants and is expected to have broad applications for small RNA expression and genome engineering., The clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated protein 9 nuclease (Cas9) system is being harnessed as a powerful tool for genome engineering in basic research, molecular therapy, and crop improvement. This system uses a small guide RNA (gRNA) to direct Cas9 endonuclease to a specific DNA site; thus, its targeting capability is largely constrained by the gRNA-expressing device. In this study, we developed a general strategy to produce numerous gRNAs from a single polycistronic gene. The endogenous tRNA-processing system, which precisely cleaves both ends of the tRNA precursor, was engineered as a simple and robust platform to boost the targeting and multiplex editing capability of the CRISPR/Cas9 system. We demonstrated that synthetic genes with tandemly arrayed tRNA–gRNA architecture were efficiently and precisely processed into gRNAs with desired 5′ targeting sequences in vivo, which directed Cas9 to edit multiple chromosomal targets. Using this strategy, multiplex genome editing and chromosomal-fragment deletion were readily achieved in stable transgenic rice plants with a high efficiency (up to 100\%). Because tRNA and its processing system are virtually conserved in all living organisms, this method could be broadly used to boost the targeting capability and editing efficiency of CRISPR/Cas9 toolkits.},

  abstract  = {CRISPR/Cas9 uses a guide RNA (gRNA) molecule to execute sequence-specific DNA cleavage and it has been widely used for genome editing in many organisms. Modifications at either end of the gRNAs often render Cas9/gRNA inactive. So far, production of gRNA in vivo has only been achieved by using the U6 and U3 snRNA promoters. However, the U6 and U3 promoters have major limitations such as a lack of cell specificity and unsuitability for in vitro transcription. Here, we present a versatile method for efficiently producing gRNAs both in vitro and in vivo. We design an artificial gene named RGR that, once transcribed, generates an RNA molecule with ribozyme sequences at both ends of the designed gRNA. We show that the primary transcripts of RGR undergo self-catalyzed cleavage to generate the desired gRNA, which can efficiently guide sequence-specific cleavage of DNA targets both in vitro and in yeast. RGR can be transcribed from any promoters and thus allows for cell- and tissue-specific genome editing if appropriate promoters are chosen. Detecting mutations generated by CRISPR is often achieved by enzyme digestions, which are not very compatible with high-throughput analysis. Our system allows for the use of universal primers to produce any gRNAs in vitro, which can then be used with Cas9 protein to detect mutations caused by the gRNAs/CRISPR. In conclusion, we provide a versatile method for generating targeted mutations in specific cells and tissues, and for efficiently detecting the mutations generated.},

  abstract  = {Over 225,000 independent Agrobacterium transferred DNA (T-DNA) insertion events in the genome of the reference plant Arabidopsis thaliana have been created that represent near saturation of the gene space. The precise locations were determined for more than 88,000 T-DNA insertions, which resulted in the identification of mutations in more than 21,700 of the ∼29,454 predicted Arabidopsis genes. Genome-wide analysis of the distribution of integration events revealed the existence of a large integration site bias at both the chromosome and gene levels. Insertion mutations were identified in genes that are regulated in response to the plant hormone ethylene.},
